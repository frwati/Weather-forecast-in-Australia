Steps:

Data Splitting (src/data/split.py)
This script is responsible for splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. It ensures that data leakage is prevented and the model is trained on one part of the data and tested on another. Example usage:
python src/data/split.py


Data Normalization (src/data/normalize.py)
This script normalizes the dataset. Normalization scales the features so that they all lie within the same range, improving model convergence during training. Example usage:
python src/data/normalize.py


Grid Search for Hyperparameter Tuning (src/models/grid_search.py)
This script performs hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search to find the optimal set of parameters for the model. It helps in improving the model's performance by systematically testing combinations of different hyperparameters. Example usage:
python src/models/grid_search.py


Model Training (src/models/train_model.py)
This script trains the model using the training data. It may involve using machine learning algorithms like RandomForest, XGBoost, or others. Example usage:
python src/models/train_model.py


Model Evaluation (src/models/evaluate.py)
After the model is trained, this script evaluates its performance on the test data, using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or mean squared error. Example usage:
python src/models/evaluate.py
